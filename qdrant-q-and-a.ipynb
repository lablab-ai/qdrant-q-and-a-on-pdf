      "Starship is a fully reusable transportation system designed by SpaceX to service Earth orbit needs as well as missions to the Moon and Mars. It is a two-stage vehicle composed of the Super Heavy rocket (booster) and Starship (spacecraft) powered by sub-cooled methane and oxygen, with a substantial mass-to-orbit capability. Starship can transport satellites, payloads, crew, and cargo to a variety of orbits and landing sites. It is also designed to evolve rapidly to meet near term and future customer needs while maintaining the highest level of reliability.\n"
